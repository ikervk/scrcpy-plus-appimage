### [RELEASES](https://github.com/ikervk/scrcpy-plus-appimage/releases)

This is a fork maintained solely to provide an AppImage build of scrcpy-plus.
For the original documentation, please refer to [the official scrcpy-plus GitHub repository](https://github.com/Frontesque/scrcpy-plus)

[AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) was tested and it works perfectly fine with this appimage.
